The most suitable data structure for this messaging application is a Simple Linear Queue (FIFO Queue). In this scenario, 
messages arrive one after another and must be processed in the exact order they are received. Since the system can handle 
only one message at a time, each message waits in line until the previous one is completed. This behavior follows the First-In, First Out (FIFO) principle,
where the first message added to the queue is the first to be processed. A simple linear queue ensures that all messages are managed 
in a fair and orderly manner, preventing any message from being skipped or delayed unnecessarily. Other types of queues, such as circular or priority queues, 
are not required here because the messages do not need priority handling or space reusability. Therefore, a FIFO based linear queue 
is the most appropriate choice for handling message processing in this application.
