To handle a large number of restaurant orders and ensure they are processed in the same sequence they are received, the most appropriate data structure is a Queue.
A queue follows the FIFO (First In, First Out) principle, which means the first order placed will be the first to be processed. 
This perfectly matches the workflow of a busy restaurant where orders must be fulfilled in order.
The two main operations required for this data structure are Enqueue and Dequeue.

Enqueue (Insertion): This operation is used to add a new order to the rear of the queue. Each order will contain details such as the order number, item name, and quantity. 
Before adding, the system must check whether the queue is full to prevent overflow.

Dequeue (Deletion): This operation removes an order from the front of the queue for processing.
Before removal, the system must check whether the queue is empty to avoid underflow.

To prevent overflow, a circular queue can be implemented so that space freed by processed orders can be reused efficiently. 
To prevent underflow, the system should check if the queue is empty before attempting to remove an order.

Once all orders are processed, the system can print the list of processed orders by traversing the queue in the same order they were served.
This ensures that the restaurant staff can verify that every order has been handled correctly and in sequence, maintaining efficiency and accuracy in service.
